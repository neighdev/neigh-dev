<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)">Wikipedia</a>,
          the free encyclopedia</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Obsidian</strong> is a personal knowledge base and note-taking
            software application that operates on Markdown files. It allows users to
            make internal links for notes and then to visualize the connections as
            a graph. It is designed to help users organize and structure their thoughts
            and knowledge in a flexible, non-linear way. The software is free for personal
            use, with commercial licenses available for pay.</p>

<p>This is the note app I tried before <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Trilium.html %}">Trilium</a>,
          I switched to <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Trilium.html %}">Trilium</a> because
          it has better syncing out of the box and is open source. The plug-in support
          for Obsidian is a better experience though. And Obsidian is better known.</p>
