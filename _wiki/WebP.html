<p>There are different compression types for <strong>WebP</strong>, there
          is lossless and lossy. (<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp">source</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lossy <strong>WebP </strong>compression uses predictive coding to encode
            an image, the same method used by the VP8 video codec to compress keyframes
            in videos. Predictive coding uses the values in neighboring blocks of pixels
            to predict the values in a block, and then encodes only the difference.</p>
<p>Lossless <strong>WebP </strong>compression uses already seen image fragments
            in order to exactly reconstruct new pixels. It can also use a local palette
            if no interesting match is found.</p>
