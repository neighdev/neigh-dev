<div class="ck-content">
<p><strong>Active Externalism </strong>is the idea that we can use our environment
          to extend our cognitive processes. One example is to use a calculator to
          perform a calculation. Another is to use <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Trilium.html %}">Trilium</a>, 
          <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Obsidian.html %}">Obsidian</a> or a notepad to store information related to your memory. </p>
<p>The paper by Andy Clark starts with <i>Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?</i> It
          dives a lot more in the implications and definitions of the border between
          mind, body and environment. For me however, <strong>Active Externalism</strong> is
          a tool I use to achieve my goals.</p>
