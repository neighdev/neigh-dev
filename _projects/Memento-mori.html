<div class="ck-content">
<p><strong>Memento mori </strong>- <i>Remember to die. </i>Reminds us that
          we all will die at some point and that it is inevitable. I was reminded
          about this when a friend passed away during a simple run. </p>
<p>The influence of our actions will always live on. With the digital age
          more than ever. I think we'll need to plan for when the inevitable happens.
          Even though this is a subject often avoided by many. I guess even for death
          failing to plan means planning to fail.</p>
<p>When we die we might want to pass specific information or control over
          to our loved ones. This project is to figure out all the things I need
          to make sure I have documented in case I am incapacitated. I won't share
          the outcome of this project but if you want to work on this for yourselves
          I'll leave some pointers which I hope will help.</p>
<p>A few things that are useful to document:</p>
<ul>
<li>A way to pass on passwords
            <ul>
<li>For example setting up an emergency contact for your password manager</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Access to cloud storage
            <ul>
<li>So loved ones can retrieve your pictures if you want. This is of course
                optional.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Access to social media
            <ul>
<li>I'd like to at least disable social media accounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subscriptions 
            <ul>
<li>Because they will need to be cancelled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some more practical things not necessarily digital
            <ul>
<li>Debts, possessions and wealth</li>
<li>Insurances</li>
<li>Wishes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there needs to be a way to make sure this information is not abused,
          if you where to write down all your passwords and instructions in a booklet
          there'd be a real issue if someone where to gain access to it when he shouldn't.
          (A burglar for example, or a “friend”.)</p>
