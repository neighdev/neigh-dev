<h2>Welcome to neigh dev</h2>
<p>I am a software engineer who likes horsing around.</p>
<p>Currently working on creating a single place for my thoughts and being
          able to share a small part of it. The result of what I want to share you
          see here. </p>
<p><strong>Technical:</strong>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;"><i>I am syncing </i><a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium#readme"><i>Trilium </i></a><i>notes using its ETAPI to create a markdown backup of a specific note tree. Parsing the metadata from ETAPI into frontmatter. And then committing the export delta's to github.</i>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;"><i>There are a few disadvantages as I have no control over the markdown that is outputted. So the </i>
<span style="color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);"><i><strong>styling</strong></i>
</span><i> of my posts is restricted to the markdown Trilium supports.</i>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;"><i>Links to pages in different categories (currently posts and pages) probably won't work either.</i>
