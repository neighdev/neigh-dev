<div class="ck-content">
<p>Because the output in markdown from Trilium was very limited I've switched
          it to HTML, and I am parsing it using a python script allowing for some
          flexibility. (I've talked about this in my <a href="{% link _posts/2023-09-12-First-post.html %}">previous </a>post.)</p>
<p>It is still more brittle than I'd like, but that is not a problem for
          me because I can just fix it as it breaks ðŸ™ƒ</p>
<p>The python script adds frontmatter, removes the header and fixes links
          to other notes.Â </p>
<p>Â </p>

<p><span class="text-small"><i>I just hope it doesn't break too often..</i></span>
</p>
