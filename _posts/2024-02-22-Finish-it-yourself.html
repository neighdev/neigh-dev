<p><i>In my </i><a href="{% link _posts/2023-12-20-Break-it-yourself.html %}"><i>previous</i></a><i> post I talked about how software breaks when you don't pay attention to it. If you're reading this it means it's still fine.</i>

<p>Just how software breaks when you neglect it so do <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _pages/Projects.html %}">Projects</a> in life, my <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Second-Brain.html %}">Second Brain</a> is meant as a
          place where I can offload things that are not immediately important so
          I can get more focus for the things that are. </p>
<p>However, when life is at its busiest it's very hard to keep it up to date.

          able to do everything I need and needing everything I do, I'll get back
          to you.</p>
