title: Trilium export fun
---

<div class="ck-content">
<p><i>Okay, fun is an alternative way to describe it.</i>
</p>
<p>To feed <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _projects/Neigh-Dev.html %}">Neigh Dev</a> it's
          pages I export notes from <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Trilium.html %}">Trilium</a> using
          a search command and then determining the root note for which to retrieve
          all the children.  </p>

<figcaption>The note tree for Neigh.dev at the time of writing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I do this pretty naively by looking through the note list for a note for
          which the parent is not in the search results. I then recreate the paths
          to the notes in memory by grabbing each note title and it's parent note
          title and it's parent note title etc etc. <strong>However, </strong>I found
          out that the title of a note is not necessarily the same as its filename. </p>
<p>So I had to parse the <i>!!!meta.json</i> file that is in the export to
          gather the names of the notes and folders on disk. The <i>!!!meta.json</i> contains
          the whole note tree that is exported.</p>
<p>Parsing that file was fun, I took the tree and flattened it into a note
          id → Note map. Every note has a list containing it's parent notes called
          the nodePath. (In <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Trilium.html %}">Trilium</a> everything
          is a note, even folders). Using the nodePath I could further parse the
          flattened list by checking the dir- or dataFileName.</p>
{% highlight python %}
meta = json.loads(output.read('!!!meta.json'))

metaNotes: dict[str, dict] = {} # Flattened meta notes 
stack: list[dict] = [meta['files'][0]] # Start at the root node
while(stack): # The stack is used to remember the previous branches we took in the tree
    tos = stack.pop()              # Pop one result of the stack 
    metaNotes[tos['noteId']] = tos # and add it to our flattened list
    if tos.get('children'): 
        for child in tos['children']:
            stack.append(child) # Add the children to our stack to walk through
    # If there are no children the stack will have shrunk in size because of the earlier pop
# The while loop ends when the stack is depleted
{% endhighlight %}
