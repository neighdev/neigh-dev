<div class="ck-content">
<p>Lately I've been busy giving all the tools I am using a new coat of paint
          (Or just pulling the newest stable image). I've replaced the old Nginx
          Proxy Manager with Traefik as the proxy manager had a tendency (for me
          at least) to corrupt its data. Now the domains are managed by the labels
          on their respective docker containers. I've moved most of my domains to
          CloudFlare (except for <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _projects/Neigh-Dev.html %}">Neigh Dev</a>)
          and I've updated the rest of the software.</p>
<p>Because I'm hosting quite a few services I thought it'd be fun to use
          the <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Trilium.html %}">Trilium</a> export
          job I made for <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _projects/Neigh-Dev.html %}">Neigh Dev</a> to
          generate a new site just for me. <i>Though, I don't really expect this site to have any visitors(, except for me of course)</i>.</p>
<p>I mentioned in <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _posts/2023-12-20-Break-it-yourself.html %}">2023-12-20 Break it yourself</a> that
          software tends to break by itself. Another weird aspect is that when you
          build software to solve a problem (or create a problem you want to solve
          with software), it doesn't automatically solve the same problem in a slightly
          different location.</p>
<p>In this case to make it work for an additional site the following things
          need to be fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The root note needs to be configured from within <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Jenkins.html %}">Jenkins</a> </li>
<li>It must be possible to select a different target than <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Github.html %}">Github</a> 
            <ul>
<li>I'd prefer to keep those pages private because they aren't useful to anyone
                but me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a lot of overlap between the <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Python.html %}">Python</a> script
            and the <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Jenkins.html %}">Jenkins</a> script,
            they need better separation.</li>
</ul>
<p>A feature on my wish-list would be to automatically trigger updates to
          the site, up until now I've always checked the results of an export before
          giving it my blessing. But there are now enough safeguards in place that
          I feel comfortable enough letting it decide on its own that it is go-time.</p>
