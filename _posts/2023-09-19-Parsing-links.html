title: Parsing links
---

<div class="ck-content">
<p>So, the <a href="{% link _posts/2023-09-17-Switched-to-HTML.html %}">previous post</a> did
          not even come through as linking the different pages together broke down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>{% raw %}I've found that Jekyll transforms pages to have different paths
          in the browser, which would be annoying if it Jekyll couldn't resolve them
          for me. Which is done with <span style="color:#ce9178;"><code>{% link yourLinkHere %}</code></span>
</p>
<p>So I slapped <span style="color:#ce9178;"><code>{% link yourLinkHere %}</code>  </span>around
          all the relative links in the documents and I thought I was done with it.{%
          endraw %}</p>
<p>However, it turns out that all the links should then be relative from
          the root directory in order for Jekyll to resolve them. </p>
<p>So I fixed that, however! It turns out that spaces in filenames are not
          allowed.</p>
<p>So I had to check all filenames for spaces and replace them with dashes,
          then filter all relative links and remove URLEncoding, and replace the
          spaces that are left over with dashes.</p>
<p>I should probably have removed url encoding when I started working with
          directory paths to begin with, but eh.</p>
<p>If it works it works.</p>
<p>If it doesn't work.. Well. It didn't.</p>
