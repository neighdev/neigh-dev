<div class="ck-content">
<p><i>So, the </i><a href="{% link _posts/2023-09-17-Switched-to-HTML.html %}"><i>previous post</i></a><i> did not even come through as linking the different pages together broke down.</i>
</p>
<p>I've been working on <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _projects/Neigh-Dev.html %}">Neigh Dev</a> and
          I've found that <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Jekyll.html %}">Jekyll</a> transforms
          pages to have different paths in the browser, which would be annoying if 
          <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Jekyll.html %}">Jekyll</a> couldn't resolve them for me. Which is done with{% raw
            %} <span style="color:#ce9178;"><code>{% link yourLinkHere %}</code></span>
</p>
<p>So I slapped <span style="color:#ce9178;"><code>{% link yourLinkHere %}</code> </span>{%
          endraw %}around all the relative links in the documents and I thought I
          was done with it.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that all the links should then be relative from
          the root directory in order for <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Jekyll.html %}">Jekyll</a> to
          resolve them. </p>
<p>So I fixed that, however! It turns out that spaces in filenames are not
          allowed.</p>
<p>So I had to check all filenames for spaces and replace them with dashes,
          then filter all relative links and remove URL encoding, and replace the
          spaces that are left over with dashes.</p>
<p>I should probably have removed URL encoding when I started working with
          directory paths to begin with, but eh.</p>
<p>If it works it works.</p>
<p>If it doesn't work.. <span class="text-small"><i>Well. It didn't.</i></span>
</p>
