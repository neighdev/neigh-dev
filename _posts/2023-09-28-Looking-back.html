<div class="ck-content">
<p>Today I'm taking a step back to look at my projects and goals. I have
          started working on <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _projects/Active-Externalism.html %}">Active Externalism </a> back
          in June to clearly lay out my goals, offload my mind and allow me to passively
          read through my thoughts.</p>
<p>I've been keeping a private journal since June and I have been refining
          the way my is organized and adds value to my life.</p>
<p>One thing I have learned in the past few months is that if there is something
          I want to do I can turn it into a <a href="{% link _pages/Projects.html %}">project</a>,
          this helps me map my mind to it and even if I don't have time for it it
          is there for me to review later. </p>
<p>This ball got rolling a long while ago with a life crafting workshop.
          Which resulted in me changing a lot of aspects about my life, setting goals
          and creating a bucketlist. </p>

<p>Back in June a colleague mentioned <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Obsidian.html %}">Obsidian</a> to
          me as a way to offload the mind and a way to keep track of my goals, I
          started out by watching a YouTube video and I have been on it ever since.</p>
<p>I did switch to <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Trilium.html %}">Trilium</a> eventually
          because issues with syncing notes in <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Obsidian.html %}">Obsidian</a> 
          caused issues for me. <i>(I switch between devices a lot during the day</i>). </p>
