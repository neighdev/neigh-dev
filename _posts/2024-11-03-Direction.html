<div class="ck-content">
<p>I'm wondering what direction to go in with this site. I'm currently not
          as active with <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _projects/Active-Externalism.html %}">Active Externalism </a>as
          I was when I started this project. I'm now sorting my thoughts once a week
          which often results in typing multiple pages worth.</p>
<p><a class="reference-link" href="{% link _projects/Neigh-Dev.html %}">Neigh Dev</a> was
          created with the idea to be able to publicly do <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _projects/Active-Externalism.html %}">Active Externalism </a>,
          also as a fun project to parse my notes and render them without having
          to do much manual labor. Which if you're reading this still works. I'm
          still just jotting down my notes in <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _wiki/Trilium.html %}">Trilium</a>
</p>
<p>A few other projects I've been busy with is recording my singing (though
          I am not confident enough to share that with many people), a migration
          to cloudflare for most of my domains (and experimenting with other cloudflare
          features), and with <a class="reference-link" href="{% link _projects/Memento-mori.html %}">Memento mori</a> where
          I figure out how to manage my (digital) legacy.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Hope to be back soon.</p>
