Welcome to neigh dev
--------------------

I am a software engineer who likes horsing around.

Currently working on creating a single place for my thoughts and being able to share a small part of it. The result of what I want to share you see here. 

**Technical:**

_I am syncing_ [_Trilium_](https://github.com/zadam/trilium#readme) _notes using its ETAPI to create a markdown backup of a specific note tree. Parsing the metadata from ETAPI into frontmatter. And then committing the export delta's to github._

_There are a few disadvantages as I have no control over the markdown that is outputted. So the_ _**styling**_ _of my posts is restricted to the markdown Trilium supports._

_Links to pages in different categories (currently posts and pages) probably won't work either._

[Projects](pages/Projects.md) _← this is probably dead jim.._
